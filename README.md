## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi there! I'm Clara, a 17 yr developper ! I mainly do Front-End stuff, but i also do like to mod Call Of Duty Games like Cod Modern Warfare or Cod World At War (Thx Infinity Wards for the tools :=) )
I'm from Canada, Quebec. I speak French, German and English so feel free to contact me with either of these three languages !
I don't do commission nor do i take part in any projects of any sorts (I just want to do silly ass projects alone :=) )
